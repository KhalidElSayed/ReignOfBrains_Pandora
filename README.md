Reign of Brains is a simple 2D Zombie shooter. It's style is similar to the TMNT arcade games. Thus far, there is one complete level, where the player can enter various doors to collect items. Items help the player survive the level and include sandwiches, health packs and ammunition. This game runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. The target platform for this game is the Pandora hand-held gaming computer. Once the device ships, I plan on spending some time optimizing the code to run really smoothly on this platform.
